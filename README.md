# KalmanFilter_in_C

A simple and accurate Kalman filter implementation.  
This implementation uses sqrt decomposition.  
It works stably even for single-precision single precision floating point matrices.  
Therefore,  
it is possible to operate even in a weak CPU like embedded system environment with a weak CPU.
